      Like with any project management methodology, there isn’t one framework that is better 100% of the time. You may choose Kanban for some projects but want to implement Scrum for others or directly force Scrum for everyone.

      Consider what level of change you want to introduce to your team. If you’re going to add something on top of an existing framework with small, incremental changes, Kanban is a better choice. If you’re looking to make a more significant process change, implementing Scrum would be better. 

      ### Kanban vs. Scrum: What if you can't choose?

      Hundreds of teams are using hybrid models influenced by both Scrum and Kanban. Here is where you can adapt both Agile frameworks to something new that works for your team. **DevOps is a complete and unique methodology that sometimes is hard to understand and even more, to implement**.

      If you are starting with DevOps, we suggest implementing a Kanban board and practicing lightweight ceremonies. When your team feels comfortable working with Issues, Estimations, Boards, StandUp Meetings, and adequately deliver, you can start implementing some helpful ceremonies and tools from Scrum like Sprints, Planning, and Retrospective Meetings.

      As I said initially, everyone wants to start implementing Scrum but **if your team does not have experience with this framework, you will end up using Scrum like a Kanban but without a continued implementation flow**.
